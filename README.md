# Full Stack MERN app

This app uses MongoDB, Express, React, and Node to put together a simple post wall for users.

To start: Clone this repository and `cd` into the root folder. Run `npm install` in the root, backend, and client folders to get all of the required dependencies for each section. Then run `npm start` in the root folder
